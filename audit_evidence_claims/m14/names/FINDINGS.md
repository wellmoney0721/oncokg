# Round 14 historical name-resolution verification

Reviewed HEAD `73ee310d970c8c3b4886bbbdfd6d88026d403c28`. Principal originally reported blocking name inputs M1-M13 are **FIXED for their exact spellings**. The supplementary M13 `A33124I` example is **NOT FIXED**. This historical result does not establish overall approval; the fresh-attack worker separately confirmed current originator leaks.

## Execution and evidence

- **55 scripts reused; 45 leaf reproductions executed**, all runner exits zero. Outputs are under m14/names; exact input inventories and historical read paths remain intact. Port **8921** is closed. [Manifest](reuse_manifest.json), [cumulative execution](round9_execution.json), [additional](additional_execution.json), [completion](completion_execution.json), [checks](worker_final_checks.json).
- Original **113-case / 7,511-key** sweep: **318** old-method differences and **69** previously linked aliases without a current Drug. These are diagnostic counts. Versus M13: **zero new losses; rad001c alone recovered**. [Sweep](names_m5_attack.json), [summary](names_m5_summary.json), [loss sets](new_alias_losses.json).
- Frozen **1,648-question** counterfactual: **68 identical / 1,556 metadata-only / 24 semantic / zero errors**, unchanged. [QA](adapted_frozen_qa_relink_sweep.json).
- **39-case** matrix only mismatches accepted M5-S2; **26** literal M6/M7 controls pass; all **19** non-M5-S2 historic alias losses remain restored. [Matrix](focused_matrix.json), [controls](historical_focus.json), [aliases](historical_alias_set_check.json).
- Replayed M9 **146 inputs / 16 QA**, M10 **1,224 inputs + 35 focus cases**, M11 **26 probes + 12 literal cases**, M12 **41 focused cases**, M13 **nine joined-label stage cases**. [M9](m9_attacks/probe_results.json), [M10](m10_attacks/probe_results.json), [focus](m10_attacks/focus_results.json), [M11](m11_attacks/key_equivalence_results.json), [M11 exact](m11_exact.json), [M12](m12_attacks/focused_results.json), [M13](joined_label_probe.json).
- Fresh evidence for **62 inherited findings** was compared with M13, retaining identities, maps, evidence and refusal existence. Only rad001c recovery changes results. The four changed aggregate lists lose exactly rad001c; all retained rows are semantically equal. [Comparison](replay_comparison.json), [adjudication](worker_final_checks.json).

## Individual historical dispositions

M2 has no completed report; partial name cases are covered by M2b's cumulative reproductions. Other workers cover DB, UI, cost and root HTTP evidence.

M13 recorded this as a supplementary corroboration, not a separately counted blocker. The originator gap remains. [Evidence](../attacks/fresh_results.json). |

## Latest repair and remaining limits

The same-drug isotope-edge rule (`src/query.py:324-338`) catches `89ZrDFO-daratumumab`: key starts with two-letter-element `89zr` and ends with same-drug key `daratumumab`. The inside-name scan (`288-297`) still catches M12 split-symbol forms. `_marked` emits Refused (`470-479`), and `_whole_name` cannot override it (`342-349`). The main M13 cases have no centre or qualified QA evidence; separate osimertinib remains available. [Stages](joined_label_probe.json).

`rad001c` and `RAD001C` now return EVEROLIMUS / CHEMBL1908360, nine trials; HEAD^ refuses both. No new lone-alias loss occurred. `A33124I` still maps to ADAKITUG and remains explicitly NOT FIXED. [Recovery](new_alias_regression.json), [remaining example](../attacks/fresh_results.json).

Seven original QA demos retain evidence counts **12, 12, 11, 1, 12, 0, 0**. Six responses equal the bfcb83d-linker counterfactual; Mvasi differs only in refusal metadata. This is a same-data method counterfactual, not a historical deployment reconstruction. [Demos](names_demo_results.json).
